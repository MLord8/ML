All of the clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms are run using the software Weka.

I used icaAnalysis.py to print out kurtosis values for the ICA datasets after I ran the code in Weka.

Code and datasets can be found here: https://github.com/MLord8/ML/tree/master/assignment3

kMeans was run using SimpleKMeans found in Cluster > Choose
EM was run using EM found in Cluster > Choose

The dimensionality reduction algorithms can be found in Preprocess > Filter > Filters > Unsupervised > Attribute
